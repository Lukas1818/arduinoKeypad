Arduino Keypad
=============

This lets you make an arduino with attached buttons run specific functions when buttons are pressed.

The idea is that it's used as a keyboard, but really you could do many other things with it.

Setup
-------------

Modifications described [here][1] required for the mutimedia(Play/Pause, volume) functionailty.

If you just want "normal" keyboard functions, no setup required/
